# Credential Workflow Platform

Welcome to the **Blocktrust Credential Workflow Platform** documentation - your comprehensive guide to building, managing, and automating verifiable credential workflows.

## Overview

The Credential Workflow Platform is a powerful, extensible system that enables organizations to:

- Create and manage verifiable credentials using W3C standards
- Design custom workflows with triggers and sequential actions
- Automate credential issuance, verification, and management
- Integrate with external systems through HTTP and DIDComm
- Implement decentralized identity (DID) management

Built on modern .NET technology, this platform provides a flexible, rule-based approach to credential orchestration while maintaining high security and compliance standards.

## Key Features

- **IFTTT-Style Workflow Engine**: Design event-driven workflows with conditional logic
- **Multiple Trigger Types**: HTTP requests, timers, manual execution
- **Rich Action Library**: 
  - Issue W3C compliant credentials
  - Verify credentials (signature, expiry, revocation)
  - Make HTTP requests to external services
  - Send emails with customizable templates
  - Create and manage DIDs
  - Communicate using DIDComm messaging
  - Generate JWT tokens
  - Custom validation with business rules
- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Securely manage multiple organizational contexts
- **Parameter Substitution**: Dynamic content in templates and HTTP requests
- **Visual Workflow Designer**: Intuitive web interface for workflow creation
