# Development report for Milestone 2 of the Credential Workflow Platform

From an external perspective, we have fallen somewhat behind schedule with the second milestone. The primary reasons were personal in nature, which required us to pause development for a few weeks, but we are now fully back on track. Additionally, there were some technical complications, and in hindsight, our commitments for this milestone turned out to be overly ambitious. Let’s address these points one by one:

First, the acceptance criteria for this milestone demanded a fully functional example of a flow that includes an HTTP trigger, a credential-issuing action, and the issuance of the newly created credential via DIDComm to a wallet. We achieved this, but doing so required building approximately 60-70% of the entire application—including the complex DIDComm communication features—much earlier than anticipated. In retrospect, we should have chosen a simpler action instead of the DIDComm integration to meet the milestone deadlines more comfortably. Though we are now behind, we expect the next milestones to follow in rapid succession. In the current estimation we expect an overall delay of the project not exceeding 1-2 months.

The challenge with the DIDComm action lay in its reliance on several external components, such as a DIDComm mediator, specific libraries, and a wallet. We initially planned to use pieces from the PRISM (later Identus) project, but these were partially unavailable, had been shut down (after the “restructuring” of the Atala team), or did not exist at all. As a result, we had to repurpose code from our earlier projects, adapt it, and invest time in training team members. For those unfamiliar, DIDComm (v2) is a decentralized communication protocol requiring additional network infrastructure (e.g., mediators, relays) and compatible SSI wallets. Demonstrating a functional example meant setting up not only our sender but also these external components.

Despite these hurdles, we continued expanding the application and creating a robust mechanism for executing workflows. We implemented a queuing system that processes each tenant’s workflows sequentially and can recover gracefully if the application shuts down mid-execution. Every “outcome” is handled as a state machine, complete with detailed logs for each trigger and action.

We also worked on features not strictly necessary for this milestone, such as the recurring timer trigger and a credential verification action. Although these weren’t required at this stage, they helped us debug more efficiently and establish a sound pattern for modeling each workflow’s internal state machine.

On the testing front, we introduced dozens of tests for most of the commands currently in place. We still lack test coverage for a few provisional sections of the code, knowing these parts are likely to change significantly in the near future. Overall, we consider the application stable despite some minor UI issues within the workflow editor. We also added preliminary improvements to handle system configurations, which will pave the way for more robust deployments in subsequent milestones.

For the next steps, we plan to finalize the remaining DIDComm components, enabling the application to receive DIDComm messages as a trigger. This should be more straightforward than the earlier DIDComm integration. We also intend to introduce new actions to validate input data—such as verifying whether an incoming credential meets certain requirements—and additional output actions, including HTTP requests and email notifications.
