Project URL: [https://projectcatalyst.io/funds/11/cardano-open-developers/blocktrust-credential-workflow-platform](https://projectcatalyst.io/funds/11/cardano-open-developers/blocktrust-credential-workflow-platform)

Project Number: 1100041

Challenge: Cardano Open: Developers

Project Manager: Bj√∂rn Sandmann

Date Project Started: March 11, 2024

Date Project Completed: May 18, 2025

Closeout-video: xxxxxxx

## Challenge KPIs
- Deliver a no-code, open-source solution that simplifies SSI adoption
- Lower technical barriers for projects integrating Verifiable Credentials which otherwise requirse deep technical knowledge
- Released v1.0.0 (Apache-2.0)
- Provided a free to use hosted version at [https://workflow.blocktrust.dev](https://workflow.blocktrust.dev)

## Project KPIs
- Successfully completed all defined project requirements and open-sourced under Apache 2.0
- Provided comprehensive documentation and a step-by-step guide for users 
- Secure tenant isolation

## Key Achievements (particularly around collaboration and engagement)
- The software is used internally for a other blocktrust project
- Discussed with several people enganged in the Cardano ecosystem

## Key Learnings
- Open standards proved essential. Rather than developing proprietary solutions, we integrated open standards like the DID Resolution spec, DID Registrar Spec for the public APIs for the project
- While the project is complete and achieved it stated technical goals, we are currently sceptical regarding the interessted of the community. Mainly because the SSI ecosystem around Prism/Identus hasn't grown as much as s we hoped for. This project in particular relies on specific use cases people have. If these use cases are not known (or not actually existant in a small speciliazed community) the project development cannot be focused, it is potentiall prone to several issues.

## Next Steps

The project will be maintained for the foreseeable future, but no further plans at the moment.

## Final Thoughts

We hope that Lace will soon support PRISM DIDs, providing projects like ours with the audience and momentum necessary for widespread adoption. SSI on Cardano, despite the ongoing development by IOG and the community has still a long way to go. While the project is completed, we can't consider this project a success - not because of the idea and the technical details, but because we could not achieve product-market fit, because of the lack of a market right now.
